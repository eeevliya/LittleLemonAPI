I've made some tests using insomnia so the database is somewhat populated. I've created catagories and 1 menu item for each category. Feel free to edit them as you like.

I've also added a .json file names LittleLemonAPITests.json. This is an insomnia export. You can import this collection to insomnia to view the tests I've performed. After creating a superuser from the shell, and creating categories from the admin panel, I've used these API tests to do everything.
